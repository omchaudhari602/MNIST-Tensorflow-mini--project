# MNIST-Tensorflow-mini--project
This project implements a two-layer neural network using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model definition, training with cross-entropy loss and SGD optimizer, and evaluation of the model's accuracy, concluding with a visualization of predictions.
